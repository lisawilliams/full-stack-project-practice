# Full Stack Project Practice

You will be presenting this early next week.  Please have a breif presentation
planned.  Presentations should be between 5 - 10 minutes long.

You may use GitHub, PowerPoint, Keynote, or any other tools you desire to
complete any part of this.

## Project Idea

My project is Auto-Mom, an application which reminds kids to do things.

## Write between 3-5 user stories

We have gone over this before. Please refer to your notes, previous repos or the
google machine if you need further assistance.

  * Users want to create an account
  * Users want to sign in to their account
  * Users want to sign out of their account
  * Users want to change their password
  * Users want to see their list of chores

## Plan your tables and columns

Table: users
Table: chores

## Create an ERD (entity relationship diagram)

These are the diagrams that show how your tables are related to one another.
(one to many, many to many, ect).

Users Have Many Chores

## Routing

What routes will you need to be able to make the proper request to your API?

/chores
/chore:id


## 3rd Party APIs

Giphy to congratulate a user on doing a chore (but only if I've already met requirements)
